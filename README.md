# MGraph

### An extendable lib of graphs.

Was developed as a part of my course work during 2 year of education at HSE.
Can be applied to graph-based projects as it provides the user with variety of models both mutable and immutable.
Can be easily extended with new graph structures by implementing several basic interfaces.

The library consists of two parts: MGraph and MGraphLayout.
Now there is only the first part as the second needs a little refactoring.
